Users can access the build-a-box experience by:
1. Clicking "Personalizar mi Caja" button on the home page
2. Navigating directly to `/build-a-box`

The flow is:
1. Select box size (4, 6, or 10 pieces)
2. Browse brigadeiros by category (ClÃ¡sicos/Temporada)
3. Use search to find specific flavors
4. Add/remove brigadeiros until box is full
5. Add completed box to cart
